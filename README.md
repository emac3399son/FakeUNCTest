# FakeUNCTest
### Fake UNC test for Windows, Linux (basically Python users and ROBLOX users)

# PY Version.
#### Implemented for pranks usually.
It is a .exe file

When you run it, it opens a console (CMD) and just does Print(" something here ")
and so on for all the functions

There is also a .py NOT Obfuscated, for people who want to mess around with it.


# LUA Version.

#### Used for ROBLOX Executors mostly.

To use it, open the FakeUNC.lua and copy the text, then head to your executor and paste it in. 
Once you execute it, it will just print out the functions and the unc test.

##### This only uses print Command and time.sleep command for .py version & .exe
##### This only uses print Command and math.random (for wait time) for the .lua version

# Have fun Pranking users!
### Make sure to star this post!
